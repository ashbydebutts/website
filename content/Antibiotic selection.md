Antibiotic selection splits into two major paradigms: empiric and definitive therapy. Before the pathogen is identified we have to operate in the lower-information decision-making space of empiric therapy, but we both can and should tighten / target our treatment choices once we have enough information to do so responsibly (the rationale for that requires a discussion of stewardship and the inherent risks of therapy).
